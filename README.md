# Proof of Community: Decentralized AI-Powered Volunteer Verification

## Overview

**Proof of Community** is a Web3 and AI-powered platform to verify and reward genuine volunteer work using blockchain-issued badges and AI-based verification. The goal is to help grassroots organizations, volunteers, and donors trust and recognize real contributions globally.

## Features

- **AI Verification:** Volunteers submit evidence (photo, document, testimonial) of their work. An AI model checks for basic validity (e.g., face/object detection, content screening).
- **Web3 Badges:** Approved submissions mint an NFT badge to the volunteerâ€™s wallet as a public, immutable record of their contribution.
- **Transparency Dashboard:** Aggregated impact stats (hours, activities, locations) are publicly viewable.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with Ethers.js/Web3.js)
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express (AI service)
- **AI:** Open-source or cloud APIs (e.g., HuggingFace, Google Vision)
- **Blockchain:** Solidity (ERC721 NFT, Ethereum testnet or Polygon Mumbai)

## How to Run (Development)

1. Clone this repo.
2. Install dependencies for each folder (`frontend`, `backend`, `contracts`).
3. Deploy the smart contract (`contracts` folder).
4. Start backend AI service (`backend` folder).
5. Start frontend (`frontend` folder).
6. Connect your wallet (testnet).
7. Submit a volunteer proof, see AI verification, and claim your badge!
